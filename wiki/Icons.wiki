*New Icons for FSM tremulous*

The icons in Trem are... how shall I say this... incredibly outdated. I've prepared a set of icons (high res) for Vista, OS X, and Linux. I'll work on XP soon, as it needs much, much smaller icons (32x32 for Desktop, 24x24 for Menu).

High Res:

The second image is fully tango compliant.
