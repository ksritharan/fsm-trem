Here is a little F.A.Q. page to help you along with upgrading your client.

*Q*. When i use your client, it seems alot brighter, how do i fix it?

*A*. In the new clients, gamma was changed to be alot brighter than the old, to fix this try the following.

  * _Type /r_gamma 1.5, or /r_gamma 2, if that doesn't work, try the below line._
  * _Type /r_overBrightBits 0, and see if that fixes it._

If neither of those help, please contact a project member.

*Q*. When I try to use your client on Mac OS X (10.2.8 - 10.3.8 PPC) it says my platform is unsupported?

*A*. The use of the 10.2.8 SDK is broken in the latest Tremulous SVN. Until this is fixed, backwards compatibility is only supported on 10.3.9 and above on both PPC and Intel Platforms.

*Q*. When i try to make a server in tremulous, my tremulous crashes!

*A*. This is due to a backporting problem, simply place [http://fsm-trem.googlecode.com/issues/attachment?aid=-3727428234723319649&name=vms-1.1.0.pk3 this] file in your base folder, and it should work again.
