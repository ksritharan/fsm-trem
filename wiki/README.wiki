Installation
=====================================
*Windows*
Place the client in C:\Program Files\Tremulous and overwrite the current client.

*Linux*
This location can vary, but most often is placed in /usr/share/libs/tremulous

*OS X*
Place the client in /Applications/tremulous-20060625 folder, assuming you downloaded to client from [http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/games/action_adventure/tremulous.html Apple - Downloads]

=====================================
QKEY
=====================================

If you do not have a QKEY, Tremulous will create one upon first startup. Though, if you have one already, it might be important to move it to the correct location.

*Windows*
The TJW QKEY is placed in C:\Program Files\Tremulous\base\. In FSM, it is located in C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Local Settings\Application Data\Tremulous.

*Linux*
Both keys are located in ~/.tremulous/base

*Mac OS X*
